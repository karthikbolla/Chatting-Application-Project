# Chatting Application Project
This is a chatting application project that I developed based on networking concepts and GUI development using AWT and Swing. The application allows users to chat with one another in real-time over a network.

## Features:
* Real-time messaging using client-server architecture.
* GUI developed using AWT and Swing libraries.
* Ability to send and receive messages, including images and files.
* 
 ## Technologies Used:
* Java
* AWT and Swing Libraries
* Networking Concepts
* 
## How to Use:
To use the application, simply download the source code and compile it in an IDE that supports Java. Once compiled, you can run the application and start chatting with other users on the network.

## Future Enhancements:
* I plan to add the following features to the application in the future:
* Login and registration functionality for users.
* Ability to create and join chat rooms.
* Chat history saving and retrieval.
* 
## Contribution Guidelines:
If you would like to contribute to the project, you can fork the repository and make your changes. Once you are satisfied with your changes, you can create a pull request and I will review it.
